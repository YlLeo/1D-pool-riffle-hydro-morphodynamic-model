# 1D-pool-riffle-hydro-morphodynamic-model
This model has the following features:
1.MacCormack scheme to calculate unsteady flow hydraculics
2.Calibrated Wilcock and Crowe (2003) relation to calculate sediment transport
3.Uncoupled manner to deal with bed evolution
4.Viparelli method to consider undate of the sediment storage layer
5.Manning relation to conside the friction
6.This model is developed for the morphodynamics of the width-variable rectangular cross-section channel
